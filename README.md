# CSCE3550Project2
This is the project 2 extended JWKS server. The project 1 base code provided by Dr. Hochstetler was used as the base of this project. ChatGPT was used to assist with this project. I used it to help me modify the /auth and /.well-known/jwks.json endpoints to work with the SQLite database. I also used it to help with a couple warnings in my code from the IDE. The prompts I used to get results were "Here is the code I am working with (paste code)" and "The attached picture (picture of requirements 2, 3, and 4 from assignment page) is what I would like to add to this code. Can you help me implement these things?". Another prompt I used after getting the results from the previous prompts is "We should use the KID from the database for the key ID instead of 'goodKID' for every key.
